# Security Policy

## Supported versions

Security fixes are provided for the current `main` branch.

## Reporting a vulnerability

Please **do not** report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.

Instead, use one of the following options:

1. **GitHub Security Advisories (preferred)**  
   Go to the repository page → **Security** → **Advisories** → **Report a vulnerability**.

2. **Private contact**  
   If Security Advisories are not available, contact the maintainer privately using a channel listed in the repository “About” section or profile.

### What to include

To help resolve the issue quickly, include:

- a clear description of the problem and impact
- steps to reproduce (ideally minimal)
- affected files/modules and versions/commit hash
- proof-of-concept code or inputs (if relevant)
- suggested mitigation (if you have one)

## Coordinated disclosure

If the report is confirmed, the maintainer will coordinate:

- a fix on `main`
- a disclosure timeline appropriate to severity
- release notes / advisory details where applicable
