**Tags:** number-theory, counterexample-search, visualization (see {doc}`../tags`)

## Highlights

- Turn “prime-generating polynomials” folklore into a crisp counterexample (Euler’s n²+n+41).
- Writes reproducible artifacts (`params.json`, `report.md`, and figures).
- Designed to surface patterns *and* “looks-true-until-it-breaks” behavior.

## Goal

Turn “prime-generating polynomials” folklore into a crisp counterexample (Euler’s n²+n+41).

## Background (quick refresher)

- {doc}`../background/prime-numbers`

## Research question

Which **prime-related claim, heuristic, or algorithm** breaks first under a clean, controlled computational sweep,
and what does the smallest or clearest counterexample (or deviation) look like?

## Why this qualifies as a mathematical experiment

- **Finite procedure:** run a bounded search / sweep with recorded parameters.
- **Observable(s):** counts, gaps, residues, runtime scaling, or first counterexample witnesses.
- **Parameter space:** vary bounds (and sometimes algorithmic choices).
- **Outcome:** plots/tables + “witness objects” for failures.
- **Reproducibility:** outputs saved to `out/e013/` with a parameter snapshot.

## Experiment design

- **Computation:** bounded enumeration / sampling with explicit limits.
- **Outputs:** figures and a short `report.md` summarizing what was found.
- **Artifacts written:**
- `figures/fig_01_prime_indicator.png`
- `figures/fig_02_initial_prime_run_lengths.png`
- `params.json`
- `report.md`

## How to run

```bash
make run EXP=e013
```

or:

```bash
uv run python -m mathxlab.experiments.e013
```

## Notes / pitfalls

- “No counterexample found” only means “none found within the configured bounds”.
- For probabilistic tests (when used), treat outcomes as *evidence*, not proof.

## Extensions

- Increase bounds and rerun (recording runtime and memory).
- Compare alternative heuristics or algorithms on the same parameter grid.
- Turn found deviations into new, tighter conjectures.
