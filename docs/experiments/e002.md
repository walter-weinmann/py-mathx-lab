**Tags:** number-theory, numerics, visualization

## Highlights

- Generate even perfect numbers from known Mersenne exponents $p$.
- Plot digits and bit-length growth vs. $p$.
- Test the approximation $\log_{10}(N(p)) \approx 2p\log_{10}(2)$.


## Goal

Generate **even perfect numbers** from known Mersenne prime exponents $p$ and visualize how fast the numbers grow.
Measure growth via **digit count**, **bit length**, and simple logarithmic approximations.

## Research question

For
$$
N(p) = 2^{p-1}(2^p-1),
$$
how do:

- $\mathrm{digits}(N)$,
- $\mathrm{bit\_length}(N)$,
- $\log_{10}(N)$

scale with the exponent $p$?

How accurate is the approximation
$$
\log_{10}(N(p)) \approx 2p\log_{10}(2)?
$$

## Why this qualifies as a mathematical experiment

The Euclid–Euler theorem tells us exactly what even perfect numbers look like, but it does not directly convey
how quickly the objects become astronomically large. This experiment uses computation and visualization to
build quantitative intuition and test simple asymptotic approximations.

## Experiment design

### Inputs

- A curated list of known Mersenne prime exponents, e.g. $p \in \{2,3,5,7,13,17,19,31,\dots\}$.

### Observables

For each exponent $p$:

- $N(p)$ as a Python integer
- $\mathrm{digits}(N(p))$
- $\mathrm{bit\_length}(N(p))$
- approximation error:
  $$
  \Delta(p) = \log_{10}(N(p)) - 2p\log_{10}(2)
  $$

### Plots

- $p$ vs. digits
- $p$ vs. bit length
- $p$ vs. $\Delta(p)$

## How to run

From the repo root:

```bash
make run EXP=e002
```

or:

```bash
uv run python -m mathxlab.experiments.e002
```

## Notes / pitfalls

- Avoid converting huge integers to decimal strings repeatedly in tight loops; compute digits using logs where possible.
- Use `int.bit_length()` for stable bit length (fast and exact).
- Keep the exponent list modest for fast docs builds; this is a growth experiment, not a search for new Mersenne primes.

## Extensions

- Compare growth to $2^{2p}$ and quantify the relative gap.
- Add a “human scale” axis: compare $\mathrm{digits}(N(p))$ to common benchmarks (atoms in the observable universe, etc.).
- Pull the exponent list from a small data file so the experiment can be updated without code changes.
