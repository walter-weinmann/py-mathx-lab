**Tags:** number-theory, quantitative-exploration, visualization (see {doc}`../tags`)

## Highlights

- Visualize how quickly $M_n = 2^n - 1$ grows in **bits** and **decimal digits**.
- Compute size metrics *without* constructing huge integers.
- Provide simple rules-of-thumb for choosing feasible bounds in later experiments.

## Goal

Quantify and visualize the growth of Mersenne numbers $M_n = 2^n - 1$ as $n$ increases.

This experiment focuses on **size** (bit-length and decimal digits), because it determines what later
algorithms (Lucas–Lehmer, sieving) can realistically handle on a laptop.

## Background (quick refresher)

- {doc}`../background/mersenne-primes`

## Research question

How fast does the size of $M_n$ grow with $n$, and what simple formulas approximate:

- the number of bits of $M_n$
- the number of decimal digits of $M_n$

## Why this qualifies as a mathematical experiment

- **Finite procedure:** evaluate size formulas on a range $n = 1..N$.
- **Observable(s):** bit-length and digit count as functions of $n$.
- **Parameter space:** vary $N$ (and optional sampling density).
- **Outcome:** visual evidence (curves) and tables usable as planning guidance.
- **Reproducibility:** parameters written to `params.json`; figures written to `figures/`.

## Experiment design

### Computation

Key facts:

- $\mathrm{bits}(2^n - 1) = n$ for $n \ge 1$.
- $\mathrm{digits}(2^n - 1) = \left\lfloor n\log_{10}(2) \right\rfloor + 1$ for $n \ge 1$.

Compute both for a grid of $n$ values.

### Outputs

- plot: $n$ vs. bits
- plot: $n$ vs. digits
- table: selected $n$ with digits (e.g., 10, 100, 1k, 10k, ...)

## How to run

```bash
make run EXP=e007
```

or:

```bash
uv run python -m mathxlab.experiments.e007
```

## Notes / pitfalls

- Avoid converting huge $M_n$ to decimal just to count digits. The logarithm formula is exact for the digit count.
- For very large $n$, use stable floating-point evaluation for $n\log_{10}(2)$ (double precision is fine up to very large $n$).
- This experiment is intentionally lightweight; it should run quickly.

## Extensions

- Overlay “feasibility bands” (e.g., digits thresholds) for what your other experiments can handle.
- Compare $M_n$ to other fast-growing families (factorials, primorials) on a log scale.
