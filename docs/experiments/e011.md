## Highlights

- Compare observed Mersenne-prime counts to a simple heuristic expectation curve.
- Visualize cumulative “found vs expected” as exponent bounds increase.
- Keep the discussion explicitly empirical (evidence, not proof).

## Goal

Mersenne primes are extremely rare. This experiment compares:

- the observed count of Mersenne primes among prime exponents $p \le P$
- a lightweight heuristic curve that grows slowly with $P$

The aim is intuition-building and trend visualization, not a rigorous model.

## Background (quick refresher)

- {doc}`../background/mersenne-primes`

## Research question

For increasing prime exponent bounds $P$:

- how does the cumulative count of “passes” from your scan grow?
- how does it compare to a simple expectation curve of the form:

  $$
  E(P) \approx \sum_{p \le P,\ p\ \mathrm{prime}} \frac{1}{p\ln 2}
  $$

## Why this qualifies as a mathematical experiment

- **Finite procedure:** run a finite scan and compute a finite expected sum.
- **Observable(s):** cumulative count of passes vs. cumulative expected value.
- **Parameter space:** vary $P$ (and optionally cap runtime per test).
- **Outcome:** plots that show agreement/divergence and suggest questions for deeper study.
- **Failure modes:** small ranges are noisy; the experiment should clearly label bounds.

## Experiment design

### Computation

- From E008 (or a fixed list), get the set of exponents tested and which passed.
- For each bound $P$, compute:

  - $\mathrm{Found}(P)$ = number of passing exponents $p \le P$
  - $E(P)$ = cumulative heuristic sum

- Plot both curves against $P$.

### Outputs

- plot: $P$ vs Found(P) and E(P)
- table: selected checkpoints (P, Found, E)

## How to run

```bash
make run EXP=e011
```

or:

```bash
uv run python -m mathxlab.experiments.e011
```

## Notes / pitfalls

- The heuristic curve is a **comparison tool**, not a theorem.
- Results depend heavily on which exponents were actually tested; record the tested set in the report.
- A single large Mersenne prime can dominate impressions—keep axes and annotations clear.

## Extensions

- Compare multiple heuristics (still empirical) and see which best matches the observed range.
- Extend the scan bound and see whether the deviation grows or stabilizes.
