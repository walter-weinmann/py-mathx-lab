## Goal

Build intuition for Taylor truncation error by visualizing the absolute error landscape
$|\sin(x) - T_n(x; x_0)|$ over a domain while varying:

- the polynomial degree $n$,
- the expansion center $x_0$.

## Background (quick refresher)

If you want a short mathematical recap first, read: {doc}`../background/background_taylor-series`.

## How to run

```bash
make run EXP=e001_taylor_error_landscapes ARGS="--out out/e001 --seed 1"
```

Artifacts are written under `out/e001/` (figures, parameters, and a short `report.md`).

## What to expect

Qualitatively (and this is what the plots should confirm):

- near $x_0$, the higher degree reduces the error quickly,
- away from $x_0$, the approximation can degrade even for higher degrees,
- changing $x_0$ shifts the “low-error region”.

## Results

After running the experiment, include (or regenerate) the figures in the documentation.
The canonical output location is `out/e001/`. For publishing, copy one representative “hero” image into
`docs/_static/experiments/` (see “Gallery images” below).

## Notes / pitfalls

- Use **log-scale** for absolute error plots to see the full dynamic range.
- Be careful interpreting relative error near zeros of $\sin(x)$.
- Huge domains and high degrees can expose floating-point artifacts that are not truncation error.

## Gallery images (recommended)

To keep the experiment gallery attractive and stable:

1. run the experiment locally,
2. pick one representative output figure,
3. copy it into the repo under:

   `docs/_static/experiments/e001_hero.png`

This allows the docs to show thumbnails without depending on generated `out/` artifacts.
