# <Topic> refresher

This page is a **lightweight** background for one or more experiments in `py-mathx-lab`.

Keep it short (1–2 pages):

**Beginner level:** assume only first-year calculus. Prefer intuition and simple examples; avoid heavy analysis jargon unless it is essential.

- the core definition(s),
- one key theorem/formula (as needed),
- what experiments usually visualize or measure,
- the most common numerical pitfalls.

## Core definitions

Provide the essential definitions with LaTeX:

$$
\text{definition here}
$$

## Key formula / theorem (optional)

State a theorem or identity that explains the expected experimental behavior.

## What experiments typically visualize

- quantity A
- quantity B
- distribution C

## Practical numerical caveats

- rounding error, cancellation, overflow/underflow
- domain restrictions / branch cuts
- stability issues

## References

See {doc}`../references`. Optionally cite 1–2 entries:
